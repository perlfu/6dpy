6dpy 
----

6dpy is a small harness to simplify Python scripting operations on a 
Canon 6D DSLR camera via PTP/IP and WLAN/Wifi.  It may also be useful
for other PTP/IP cameras with some minor modifications.

The harness deals with locating and connecting to cameras. MDNS is used to 
search for the camera(s) in EOS Utility mode.  A connection is then 
established using libgphoto2's PTP/IP code and passed to user code.

Canon's PTP/IP authentication is bypassed using the GUID decoding 
technique documented by Daniel Mende in his talk Paparazzi over IP. 

Requirements:
 * pybonjour (https://code.google.com/p/pybonjour/)
 * libgphoto2 (http://www.gphoto.org)

All harness code is contained in 6d.py.
Other Python scripts demonstrate usage.
